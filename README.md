# Document_summary
Document summarizer is an innovative tool designed to transform the way we interact with lengthy documents. This project combines the power of OpenAI's GPT models, Streamlit's interactive web frontend, and Chroma DB's vector database technology to provide instant, concise summaries of extensive files.

# How It Works
Select the type of document you want to summarize.
Upload the document
The application reads and processes the document using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
The summary of your document is displayed on the same page in English and French language.
